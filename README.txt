bugs fixed:
-spelled disabled wrong (diabled)
-need to load script after DOM is loaded
-spelled lost-message as lostMessage
-equivalency wrong inside check guesses
-state not changing back to waiting from disabled after clicking a non-final color (edited) 

known issue:
-appears to be an error with clicking too fast, but we didnâ€™t resolve this
